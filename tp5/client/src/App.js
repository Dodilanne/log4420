/*
* README @charg√© :
* Our implementation relies on the use a Redux store, which allows
* us to keep an application level state that persists throught navigation.
* After an initial fetch of the data (see the Router component), components then
* obtain their data directly from the Redux store throught the use of the useSelector
* hook. This removes the need of constantly fetching data from the server and passing 
* heavy objects throught component props. The store state is kept up to date by dispatching
* a corresponding Redux action whenever a state modifying request is successfully processed
* by the server (See client/foundation/thunks).
